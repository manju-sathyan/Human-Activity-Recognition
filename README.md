This project implements a machine learning pipeline for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using the UCI-HAR dataset, which contains accelerometer and gyroscope readings collected from smartphones. The goal is to classify different human activities such as walking, sitting, standing, and lying down based on sensor signals. The notebook demonstrates the full process of data preparation, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
Running the Project
1) Clone this repository.
2) Download and place the UCI-HAR dataset inside the data/ folder.
3) Open the notebook:
jupyter notebook HumanActivityR.ipynb
4) Run all cells to reproduce the results.
